# Hangman
A Python program that asks the user to enter a secret word, then asks them to enter a letter that they think is in the secret word. They get 6 guesses, and if they guess correctly, they will be congratulated, if not, they lose.

## What I learned
- Using the 'sys' module to exit the program
- Getting input from the user, then storing that input in a variable
- Getting the length of a variable
- Creating and calling function
- Using for, if, and while loops
